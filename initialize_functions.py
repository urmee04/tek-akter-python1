'''
A function is a block of code that you can name and that performs a certain task. You can run the block many times by using the function name. The definition of a function specifies its name and the data the function needs to work. Parameters are the variables in the function that hold this data.

An if statement allows you to set a condition on whether certain code runs. For example, using a variable called game_active, you can use an if statement to ensure the code that starts a game runs only if this variable is set to True.

Boolean values can represent the state of a program or a certain condition. For example, you can use variables such as game_active, can_edit, and polling_open, which take either a True or False value. When these values are True, certain code sections are enabled as the program runs.
